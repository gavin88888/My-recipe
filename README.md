# My-recipe
I ditched the MSG, if you want to add it back in, Accent Seasoning will do the trick and you can add 1/2 teaspoon for every pound of chicken used. It definitely seems to be the X factor here for that final kick of nostalgic flavor, so again if you want the 100% real deal, grab a canister and add away.
I reduced the paprika by 1 tablespoon. The flavor seemed off to me, and in a comparison of color I found 3 tablespoons to be a better representation of the original. Want to stick to the recipe the Chicago Tribune uncovered? Use the full 4 tablespoons.
Last change, but a really big one. If you were to buy some KFC Original Recipe Chicken and really inspect the breading of the chicken you will find dark specks. Yes, those specks are your herbs and spices, but guess what else they are? Uniform. Maybe to hide the recipe since shapes may give away ingredients. Maybe to prevent the overpowering flavor of biting into an entire piece of dried thyme. Either way, I pulverized the thyme, basil and oregano in my small food processor. Bingo, tiny specks. üòâ
I added more oil (truth: I used my deep fryer, but if you just add more oil, you‚Äôll have a full deep fry in a larger stockpot) instead of the cast iron skillet fry that was done in the recipe as printed.

KFC Original Recipe Chicken uncovered by a food reporter from Colonel Sander's nephew and republished with all 11 herbs and spices to make picture perfect KFC chicken at home!

Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 tablespoon salt
1/2 tablespoon dried thyme leaves
1/2 tablespoon dried basil leaves
1/3 tablespoon dried oregano leaves
1 tablespoon celery salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon dried mustard
3 tablespoons paprika (original recipe calls for 4 tablespoons)
2 tablespoons garlic salt
1 tablespoon ground ginger
3 tablespoons ground white pepper
2 teaspoons Accent Seasoning , optional (I left this out)
1 cup buttermilk
1 large egg
1 chicken , cut into 10 pieces (2 wings, 2 legs, 2 thighs and 2 breasts each cut in half to make 4 breast pieces)
vegetable oil for frying
US Customary - Metric
Instructions
Note: click on times in the instructions to start a kitchen timer while cooking.

Add the spices to a small food processor until they're all uniform in size and the thyme, basil and oregano aren't larger in size anymore.
Add the flour in a bowl with all the herbs and spices and mix with a whisk.
In a second larger bowl add the buttermilk and egg together and whisk until combined.
Add the chicken to the buttermilk mixture for 20-30 minutes.

Remove chicken from the buttermilk soak and let any excess buttermilk drip off.
Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour mixture on all sides, then shake off the excess coating.
Let it rest on a cookie sheet for 20-30 minutes.

Add oil to a deep fryer or a large pot that is at least 5 inches high so that the chicken can be fully submerged.
Heat the oil to 350 degrees and fry in small batches for 15-18 minutes.

Remove the chicken from the oil and add to a drying rack on top of a clean cookie sheet.
If you add it to a paper towel or newspaper the bottom of the chicken will steam from the heat and become soft.

Recipe Notes
So here it is, in all its glory. I did make a couple of adjustments in my side by side comparison during recipe testing. More details of how/why available in the post above this recipe card.

I ditched the MSG.
I reduced the paprika by 1 tablespoon.
I pulverized the thyme, basil and oregano in my small food processor.
I added more oil

Thanks so much to the awesome folks at the Chicago Tribune for this KFC Original Recipe Chicken "copycat."

not going to rate because I‚Äôve yet to try the seasonings. right off, though, this recipe is wrong.

my aunt worked at a local Kentucky Friend Chicken for years post divorce, and the big secret other than those spices, they pressure cook the chicken pieces FIRST. Then it coat up and FRY for that wonderful skin and flavor.

Ever notice how the chicken just nearly falls apart? this is the pressure cooking. my understanding is that the chicken is purely cooked in pressure cooker, also, not partially then finished up in deep fryer.

Secret to the bar-b-que‚Äôd chicken ‚Äì if you recall that they previously had such a type of chicken, it‚Äôs the day old chicken pieces or whole part that are then slathered in the Kentucky Friend Chicken house sauce that was thick, bright translucently red and sweet w/ a touch of savory.

I have worked for KFC for a couple years. The key missing step from all the recipes for this is that Col. Sanders, and KFC Restaurants, presser cook the chicken in a Original is pressure cooker. The extra crispy is deep fried, but the original is pressure cooked. Also, the chicken is prepped in a basket that sets in the prep machine until it reaches 70. Then it is breaded, dipped in an ‚Äòegg dip and breaded again. The extra crispy is breaded twice and put into a deep fryer until it‚Äô done. The breading comes premixed and in a 50 pound bag. When the chicken is done right‚Ä¶.

I didn‚Äôt see your comment before saying the same thing about the pressure cooking of the chicken.

I do recall that it sat breaded up (?) in a basket waiting for frying? I believe that was what they basket was used for ‚Äì dumping the extra flour as I recall it being explained by my aunt.

You can find powdered buttermilk in almost any grocery store, on the baking isle. Walmart carries it.

I grew up 30 miles as the crow flies, in Eastern Kentucky. I met Colonel Sanders several times. He was a sharp business man known for his love of young ladies.
I remember him hitting on a date when I was in college in 79‚Ä≤ at Boone‚Äôs tavern in Berea.

The only ingredients that really mattered were MSG and white pepper. Both very unique in those days. Every house wife in Kentucky knew it.

That was not his secret. He used fresh farm raised chickens, A different experience from our modern ones, and a pressure cooler to fry them in. High quality consistent food.
I remember the original chicken. It was nothing like today. The original was better than Popeye‚Äôs or Churches.

John Y Brown had to pay him an extra million dollars to get him to stop going into the restaurants in Lexington and Louisville and screaming about the quality of the food.
Literally no one one tasted original KFC after 1964

I tried this recipe and was very careful to follow the recipe. The chicken looked great. However, it was very ‚Äúhot‚Äù. There seems to be far too much pepper and maybe paprika. The result tasted more like a very hot version of Chester‚Äôs Chicken and in no way resembled the taste of KFC. I was very disappointed.

The Reason Is In The Amount Of White Pepper In This !!! White Pepper Is A Lot Hotter Than Black Pepper , And A Little Goes A LONG Way !!!
